# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images using Machine Learning

> A deep learning research project for binary classification of brain MRI scans (Tumor vs. Healthy) using fused CNN feature extraction, Black Hole Optimization (BHO) feature selection, and a custom Optimized SGD Logistic Regression classifier.

📄 **Paper submitted to IEEE Intelligent Systems — awaiting first round of review**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. Instead of relying on a single model, it fuses deep features from three pre-trained CNN backbones into a rich 3,840-dimensional feature vector, applies Black Hole Optimization to select the most discriminative features, and trains a custom Optimized Stochastic Gradient Descent (Opt-SGD) logistic classifier from scratch.

The pipeline was developed as a Master's research project at Lakehead University and run on Kaggle using GPU-accelerated Jupyter Notebooks.

### Dataset Details
 
**Dataset 1 — BRISC 2025**
A recently introduced benchmark dataset for MRI-based brain tumor classification. It provides high-quality labeled scans covering a broad range of tumor sizes, shapes, and locations, making it well-suited for testing model performance across varied clinical presentations.
 
**Dataset 2 — SciDB + Masoud Kaggle 2025**
A composite dataset formed by merging the SciDB medical imaging collection with Masoud Nickparvar's Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle. Combining scans from multiple independent sources introduces greater data diversity, which helps models learn more generalizable features across different tumor morphologies.

 
**Dataset 3 — Mendeley 2025**
A publicly available MRI dataset curated specifically for brain tumor detection tasks. It spans multiple tumor categories captured under varying imaging conditions, offering a realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating how well a model holds up in clinical settings.

## ⚙️ Key Components

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- Letterbox resize to 224×224 (aspect-preserving with zero-padding)
- Pixel normalization to [0, 1]
- MRI-safe light augmentation: random rotation (±10°), translation (5%), zoom (5%), contrast (5%)
- Backbone-specific `preprocess_input` applied per model

### 2. Feature Extraction (Transfer Learning)
Three ImageNet-pretrained CNN backbones used as frozen feature extractors with Global Average Pooling:

| Backbone | Output Features |
|---|---|
| ResNet50 | 2,048 |
| VGG16 | 512 |
| EfficientNetB0 | 1,280 |
| **Fused** | **3,840** |

All three feature vectors are concatenated to form a rich, multi-scale representation of each MRI image.

### 3. Black Hole Optimization (BHO) Feature Selection
A metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by black hole physics. BHO iteratively selects the most discriminative subset of features from the 3,840-dimensional fused vector, reducing it to approximately 2,000 optimal features while preserving classification accuracy and reducing inference time.

### 4. Custom Opt-SGD Logistic Classifier
A logistic regression classifier built entirely from scratch using a hybrid optimization strategy:
- **Full gradient anchor** computed at the start of each epoch
- **Stochastic inner updates** using a random number of mini-steps per epoch
- **L2 regularization** applied to weights only (not bias)
- Trained for 150 epochs with learning rate 0.005

This notebook was developed and run on **Kaggle** with GPU acceleration.

### Run on Kaggle
1. Upload the notebook to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Enable GPU accelerator under **Settings → Accelerator → GPU**
